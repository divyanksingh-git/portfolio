## Bounce Game
The Nokia Bounce game made in Godot is a recreation of the classic mobile game originally released by Nokia in 2002. The game features a simple but addictive gameplay mechanic where the player controls a bouncing ball through various levels while collecting gems and avoiding obstacles.

The game has a retro design with pixelated graphics and a chiptune soundtrack that adds to the nostalgic feel. The player controls the ball's movement using the arrow keys or by tilting the screen, just like in the original game.

There are multiple levels to play, each with its own unique design and obstacles to avoid. The player must navigate the ball through the levels, avoiding spikes, gaps, and other hazards while collecting gems to progress to the next level.

The game has a scoring system, and the player earns points for collecting gems and completing levels quickly. There are also power-ups to collect, such as extra lives and invincibility shields, to help the player through the more challenging levels.

The game is simple and easy to learn but provides a challenging experience as the levels become more difficult. It is suitable for players of all ages and skill levels and is a fun way to relive the nostalgia of the original Nokia Bounce game.
